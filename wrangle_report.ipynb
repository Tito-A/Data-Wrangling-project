    "    WeRateDogs Twitter data is used in this project. I gathered 3 datasets: twitter_archive_enhanced.csv, image_predictions.tsv, and tweeet_json.txt.  The first one was made available and i just uploaded the file and read into it. i used requests library to download the second dataset. The third was meant to gathered by querying the twitter api, but since i was not given access to twitter api i had to use the alternate method. In which i used the provided tweet_json.txt file to gather the data into a dataframe.\n",
    "        With all three datasets gathered, i proceeded to access the datasets. Twitter_archive_enhanced.csv became twitter_archive, image_predictions.tsv became image_df and tweet_json.txt was gathered into tweet_df dataframe. i accessed the dataframes both pragmatically in the notebook and visually using excel and notepad on my system and made note of 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues. I then proceeded to clean the issues using define code test technique.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        I had quite a lot of issues defining my codes to do exactly what i want with the datasets. For example in trying to make the four dog stage columns into one, i tried various methods. Using the melt function gave duplicated data rows which is just another issue to fix. Using if statement to take a count of the rows will omit the rows with multiple dog_stages stated in the text. Finally i found the lambda apply join statement which did exactly what i wanted. But then another issue arose, the 'None' statement in these columns. I managed to fix all the isssues which are well documented in the notebook and i went on to make visualizations.\n",
    "        In the process of analysing the data i realised new issues with my dataset and had to go back to assessing and cleaning my dataset. Once fixed, i finally made insights concerning the dog_stages in particular. "
